#MERN Stack Milestone Project 
###This is a grocery list application with user/login functionality and an api to get recipes for things you might want to cook.

Inspiration: We wanted to stretch our learning by creating a grocery list application that allows users to log in, look up recipes, and create a grocery list. Users can use the recipes to help them create their grocery lists or they can just use the grocery list app to help them keep track of what they need to buy. The application has been kept simple and easy to use, because most user who would use this application could be a busy mom, someone on a budget, or someone who is looking to create a meal plan for themselves or their family.
